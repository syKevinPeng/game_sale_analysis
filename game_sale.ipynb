Most of the other genres experienced a linear growth, and a few unpopular genres have very limited growth.\n",
    " - Further on dataset issues discussed above: From the dataset, we obtain the graphs that have similar shapes to the first graph (Global Sales vs. Year). However, this time we are not adding up sales, but just counting numbers of games instead. Both plots have sharp decrement after 2010, therefore, it's reasonable to identify that there are a large amount of video game sale data not collected after 2010.\n",
